        <p className='descriptionabout'> Hey there! I am a first year student at Waterloo, and am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
            I hope to work in the financial tech industry, but am also incredibly interested in Corporate Law!</p>
        <p className='descriptioncont'>In my free time, I enjoy baking, trying new foods, watching movies and learning new languages! My current goal is to become fluent in French, and hopefully Korean in the future. I used to dance ballet and play the violin, and still occasionally do both of these activities.
            My current goal is to read 12 books this year! Some of my favourite novels include Wonder, 1984, and the Glass Hotel. Add me on GoodReads @Alena so we can recommend books to each other! </p>
